    The Web of Things (WoT) Interest Group (IG) in the World Wide Web Consortium is actively working on standard technologies for IoT interworking. In this IG, they aim to reduce costs through the global reach of Web standards, to enable open markets of services, and to unleash the power of the network effect. In this paper, we introduce the WoT works and show the result of implementation for applying WoT to our IoT device.

    Most existing building automation systems are operated with rule-based settings. These systems are wasting a lot of energy because the systems can not properly cope with changes in indoor/outdoor environments. In this paper, we propose hybrid inference for inferring indoor environments in the building using real-time stream data coming from BAS. Hybrid inference consists of Runtime Stream Processing and Semantic Lift Processing. Runtime Stream Processing deduces occupancy and thermal comfort using machine learning technology with historical data. Semantic Lift Processing uses the semantic inference to extract new knowledge based on inferred results from Runtime Stream Processing. On the basis of stored semantic-based data in the ontology, Semantic Lift Processing derives energy waste space based on occupancy and thermal comfort by using semantic technology.

    Korea has continued to receive international pressure on GHG (Greenhouse Gas) reduction as it is the world's seventh-largest GHG emission source, and the government has already submitted to the UN INDCs (Intended National Determined Contributions) to reduce 37% of its GHG emission compared to a Business As Usual (BAU) in post-2020 on June 2015. There are various methods to save energy in order to fulfill this reduction obligation. The most effective methods are to increase the energy efficiency of the building, which accounts for about 30% of the existing energy consumption in Korea. Most of the existing buildings do not use 30% of the building space. To reduce this, a system such as BEMS (Building Energy Management System) is needed to grasp and monitor the environment inside the low-cost buildings. However, most BEMS systems are very expensive, and smallscale buildings are difficult to apply because of the low cost of investment. In this paper, we propose a system for inferring the energy use status of each space by collecting environmental information of existing buildings using IoT device. The IoT sensor uses the temperature, humidity, CO2 (Carbon Dioxide), and PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor to judge whether the thermal comfort of the room and the room is occupied or not, and whether the energy is efficiently consumed by the space. Finally, the intelligent system can utilize the historical data of the inferred occupant to predict the occupancy in advance for the control.
