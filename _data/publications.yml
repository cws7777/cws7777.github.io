    Accepted in *WACV 2026*.  
    Proposes **HSR**, a Hybrid State Representation that combines **Semantic State Graphs (SSGs)** with targeted **Question–Answer probes** to capture both structural precision and contextual clarity in procedural states.  
    A heterogeneous encoder with visual–state alignment grounds the representation in video.  
    Achieves new state-of-the-art **Success Rate (SR)** on COIN, CrossTask, and NIV; ablations confirm the complementary benefits of SSG and QA components.
